#XREF: bastoken.txt - BASIC tokens
#      dostoken.txt - Dragon DOS tokens

A single line record is of the format
        word    <PTR_NEXT_LINE>
        word    <LINE_NUM>
        byte[]  <TOKENISED_DATA>
        byte    $00     End of line delimiter

PTR_NEXT_LINE is the memory address of the next line (should be the byte
  after the $00 delimiter.)

LINE_NUM in binary format - over 32,767 sometimes causes signing errors

TOKENISED_DATA - any byte > $7f is a token, $ff defines a function token as the
  next token byte

The end of data is represented by 2 null bytes, i.e. a $0000 mem pointer.
