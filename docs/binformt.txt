#TODO: check different filetypes

Three standard file types exist under Dragon Dos - these are
        .DAT - standard data file
        .BAS - BASIC tokenised file
        .BIN - binary image file
Contents of DAT file are typically in Ascii style text format

BAS and BIN are essentially the same - both start with an 9 byte header of
the following format:

     Offset:  Type:   Value:
        0       byte    $55     Constant
        1       byte    <FILETYPE>
        2:3     word    <LOAD>
        4:5     word    <LENGTH>
        6:7     word    <EXEC>
        8       byte    $AA     Constant
        9-xxx   byte[]  <DATA>

NOTE: words are Motorola hi-order format

<FILETYPE> is
        $01     for BAS
        $02     for BIN
  Remainder are undefined under standard Dragon DOS.  The type $03 may have
  been used in DosPlus from Phil Scott for a gapped m/c binary. (?? check)

?? Result on 'RUN'ning a file of the wrong type is not known

<LOAD> is the data load address - typically $2401 for a .BAS file although
  uncertain whether this is actually used.

<LENGTH> is length if <DATA> block that follows i.e. complete file should be
  <LENGTH>+9 bytes long

<EXEC> is execute address stored in $9d:9e for default EXEC addr if the
  data/program is LOADed - if the BIN file is RUN this defines the entry point
  that is jumped to.  For a BASIC program this is always $8B8D
